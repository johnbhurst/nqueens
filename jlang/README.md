# J Language

[J](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J_(programming_language)) is a functional array programming language.

I have limited experience with it and do not know how to compile standalone programs with it or report function execution times.

Here is an interactive console session showing how to use the [nqueens.ijs](nqueens.ijs) script file to solve N-Queens problems.

``` bash
/Applications/j64-807/bin/jconsole
   0!:0 < 'nqueens.ijs'
   Solve New 10
724
```

# N-Queens: Comparing Different Programming Languages

I've been playing with this problem since the 1980s, and I have implemented programs for it in at least a dozen programming languages.
The earliest dated program of mine that I can find is a Pascal one from 1987.
But there's also a BASIC one here, which is not dated, but might be older!

Also in 1987 I read this paper:  
[Harold S Stone & Janice M Stone "Efficient search techniques - An empircal study of the N-Queens Problem", IBM Journal of Research and Development Vol 31, Issue 4: July 1987](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5390100/),
which outlines a fascinating way to improve the performance of the backtracking algorithm.

My programs use backtracking iteration.
When I started with this problem, I did not realise that there are fast algorithms to find a single solution.
See for example [Anany Levitin & Maria Levitin, "Algorithmic Puzzles", Oxford University Press (2011)](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/algorithmic-puzzles-9780199740444).
So I focused on finding and printing single solutions.

## BASIC

The BASIC implementation here uses line-numbers, but also has ```WHILE/WEND```, which my old TRS-80 Level 2 BASIC did not have.
So, I don't recall when I wrote it, which BASIC it was, or how to run it.

## C
